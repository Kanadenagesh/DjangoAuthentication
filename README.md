## Django Authentication
Evey time we develop a web application authentication system is always required to authenticate user to access the data.
it's important to check if the user is really eligible to do the same.
Django provides the efficient way to manage all the user and access to the database.
this repository contains the implementation of authentication system.
The New user can sign up and existing users can login to the application.
If user provides invalid credentials,he is not allowed to access the application.
